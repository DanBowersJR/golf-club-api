# Reflection

**Time Spent:**  
I spent about 6â€“7 hours total working on this project, including setting up the initial Spring Boot structure, configuring Docker and MySQL, and testing the APIs in Postman.

**Resources Used:**
- Class lectures and code examples
- Spring Boot official documentation
- Docker documentation
- Postman for API testing
- GitHub for version control

**Challenges Faced:**  
The main challenge was setting up Docker Compose so that MySQL and the Spring Boot application connected properly. I also had to carefully structure the relationships between Members and Tournaments to allow adding participants and retrieving them correctly.

**Current Status:**  
All required endpoints for Members and Tournaments were implemented. The project runs successfully in Docker with MySQL, and the APIs were tested in Postman. A README and LICENSE have also been added to the repository.
